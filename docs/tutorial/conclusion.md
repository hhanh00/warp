# Conclusion

We took a tour of Zcash, where we learned how transactions use your wallet notes
and how this impacts privacy. Zcash has several active pools of funds, and as a
result, the confidentiality of a transaction depends on what notes your wallet
has and where you are sending it.

To simplify the user experience, some wallet apps, like Zashi, require you to
put all your funds into the Orchard pool before you can use them.

However, if you pay someone with a Sapling wallet, your transaction reveals the
amount. 

::: warning
Until every wallet app supports Orchard, users need to be aware that **privacy in
Zcash is a spectrum**. From a t2t transaction to an o2o transaction, we move from
*no privacy* to *complete privacy*. Understanding this spectrum is paramount to
making informed decisions.
:::

Wallet apps cannot foresee what type of address you will send funds to, so they
will always make assumptions and compromises.

I encourage you to try various scenarios and observe the resulting privacy
level.
