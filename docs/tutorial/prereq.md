# Prerequisites

In this tutorial, we will assume that you are comfortable
with using the command line and that you know how to
edit configuration files.

Moreover, you need to have `zcashd` and `lightwalletd`
installed. Therefore, you might have to build
these apps from their source code on Github or use
a binary package.
