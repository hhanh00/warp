## What is Zcash?

Zcash is a cryptocurrency that was launched in 2016. It's designed to provide **enhanced privacy and anonymity** for users compared to Bitcoin. Here are some key points about Zcash:

1. Privacy: Zcash uses a cryptographic technique called zero-knowledge proofs, specifically zk-SNARKs (Zero-Knowledge Succinct Non-Interactive Argument of Knowledge), which allows transactions to be verified without revealing information about the sender, recipient, or amount transferred.
1. *Optional privacy*: Zcash offers both transparent and shielded transactions. Users can choose to make their transactions fully private or transparent (just like Bitcoin), depending on their needs.
1. Supply: There's a fixed total supply of 21 million Zcash coins (ZEC), similar to Bitcoin.
1. Use cases: Its privacy features make it attractive for users who prioritize financial privacy.
